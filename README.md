Hi There,

I’m a senior full-stack engineer based in India, focused on modernizing and stabilizing production systems. My work typically involves improving performance, reliability, and long-term maintainability of web applications that have outgrown their original design.

I’ve spent most of my career working across JavaScript/TypeScrip, React, Node.js, Java, and related backend systems, often in environments where changes must be incremental, predictable, and low-risk. Alongside application development, I’ve worked closely with deployments, CI/CD, and infrastructure concerns to ensure systems behave reliably in production.

In recent years, I’ve also been involved in blockchain and Web3 infrastructure, operating validator and witness nodes and maintaining supporting tooling. This work has reinforced my approach to engineering: clear boundaries, careful upgrades, and responsibility for live systems.

I enjoy building, debugging, and improving real systems, and I share practical learnings through writing and community contributions when time allows.

I’m currently open to contract and part-time work, particularly where modernization, stabilization, or production reliability is the priority.
